U​se syslog() to log information to your syslog file (located in /var/log/syslog). 
Use "man syslog" to view information on how to use syslog() in your program. 


1. 
I​f you like to send the uname -a command  from within  your program, you could use:

int main()
{
      system("uname -a | tee /var/log/messages");  // or the log file where syslog dumps text.
}


2.
If you intend to print directly to syslog, first clear it with:

    echo > /dev/null | sudo tee /var/log/syslog

For the first line you need to print uname -a, use logger command on the command line:

    logger [COURSE:2][ASSIGNMENT:1]: `uname -a`

The rest happens within your code:

    openlog ("[COURSE:1][ASSIGNMENT:1]", LOG_NDELAY, LOG_DAEMON); 

    syslog(LOG_DEBUG, " Hello.."); 

Note:
You can use the syslog(LOG_DEBUG, ) as you would printf. Just that the 
syslog will print to the syslog which is what the assignment asks.
Finally make sure to #include <syslog.h>


3.
T​he last part is the code compilation:
    1. The source code is  pthread.c.
    2. The gcc compiler is already preinstalled on RasPi.
    3. Compile with 'make' or:
    $ gcc -o pthread pthread.c -lpthread
    4. Run with:
    $ ./pthread

Command to show cpu usage and load:
    htop
